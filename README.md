# MayhemModReroller

AHK Script made by u/WitchClaireBear

HOW TO USE - AHK must be installed before using
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) Get an individual screenshot of each Mayhem Modifier you want.
      NOTE: Be sure to NOT capture beyond the limits of the modifier's "zone". Examples of working images can be seen at https://imgur.com/gallery/plTdFwk
2) Save these images as Mod1.png, Mod2.png, Mod3.png, and Mod4.png in the same folder/directory as the AHK script
3) Run the AHK script
4) In the mayhem menu keep the Borderlands 3 window focused and the cursor away from the modifier text
5) Press F1 to start the script

The script will automatically reroll modifier until you get a result matching the 4 or less png files you saved. Additionally you can press F2 to pause the script and F3 to refresh the script. If searching for 3 or less modifiers you will have to manually cycle the modifiers then press F3 then F1 to keep searching.

"I started the script but it's not cycling"
Make sure your files are saved correctly, if the script cannot find a matching image file it will automatically consider that the modifier was found. OR the modifiers you are looking for might already be on screen just reroll it once manually and restart.

Hopefully this will allow you to go afk and enjoy something rather then spending an hour rerolling modifier. Thanks to Reddit u/Kalersays for helping me test this script.
