# MayhemModReroller

AHK Script made by u/WitchClaireBear

HOW TO USE - AHK must be installed before using
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) Get an individual screenshot of each Mayhem Modifier you want.
      NOTE: Be sure to NOT capture beyond the limits of the modifier's "zone". Examples of working images can be seen at https://imgur.com/gallery/plTdFwk
2) Save these images as Easy.png, Medium.png, Hard.png, and VeryHard.png in the same folder/directory as the AHK script
3) Run the AHK script
4) In the mayhem menu keep the Borderlands 3 window focused and the cursor away from the modifier text
5) Press F1 to start the script

The script will automatically reroll modifier until you get a result matching the 4 png files you saved. Additionally you can press F2 to pause the script and F3 to refresh the script.

If you get an error press F3 to stop the script and try following the steps above again

Hopefully this will allow you to go afk and enjoy something rather then spending an hour rerolling modifier. Thanks to Reddit u/Kalersays for helping me test this script.
